title: "Using big data for evaluating development outcomes: a systematic map"
---

The paper is based on a systematic mapping of the studies that use big data  to measure and evaluate development outcomes. In this paper we discuss methodological, ethical and practical constraints relating to the use of big data. The systematic map includes impact evaluations (IEs) that use big data to evaluate development outcomes, systematic reviews of big data IEs and other measurement studies that innovatively use big data to measure and validate any development outcomes. This study also explores the sectoral and geographical spread of big data's use in international development.  This map includes studies written in English and published between 2005 and 2019, regardless of the target country's income level or population's status. We provide detailed breakdowns in the map for different country income classifications, fragile contexts, and population characteristics. From the initial list of 17,393 studies, we arrived at a final list of 437 studies which included 48 impact evaluations, 381 measurement studies and 8 systematic reviews.
