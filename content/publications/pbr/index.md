title: Making data accessible- lessons learned from computational reproducibility of impact evaluations
---
**Abstract**

Our descriptive study assesses the computational reproducibility of impact evaluation data by verifying the results presented in published 3ie reports. Using the original data and statistical code submitted by researchers, we use the push button replication protocol developed at 3ie to determine the level of comparability of the reproduced results to the original findings. Our sample includes completed 3ie-funded impact evaluations commissioned between 2008 and 2020. We find that of the 133 studies in our sample about three-fourths of the evaluations in our sample are reproducible. This high rate of replication is largely attributable to the stringent payment-linked measures that 3ie adopted during this study. In our view, donor organizations, who are often commissioners of evaluations, can play a key role in ensuring confidence in evaluation studies. To this end, we describe our experience of the reproducibility process, and offer lessons learned.
