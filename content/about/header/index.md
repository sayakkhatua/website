Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at the School of Public Policy, Oregon State University. My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of development economics, education, labor, migration, program evaluation, and research ethics.

Previously, I worked as an Evaluation Specialist for the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), on transparency, reproducibility and ethical evidence (TREE) and managed international development projects across Asia and Africa. I also co-founded the Data innovations group at 3ie, which works on pushing the frontiers of evaluation research by using innovative methodologies and data.
