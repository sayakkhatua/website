title: Human Capital Investments of Young Hispanics- The Bright Side of the Great Recession?
---
**Abstract**

This paper analyzes the impact of the labor demand shocks in-
duced by the Great Recession on the human capital investments of
young Hispanics, a disadvantaged sub-group in United States on the
basis of their education. Using a Bartik approach where we construct
labor demand shocks separately by race group and ethnicity at the
metropolitan area level to analyze their impact on schooling decision
of young cohorts. We find that the higher responsiveness of young
Hispanics, even conditional on the differential size of the shock expe-
rienced by Hispanics relative to other groups, can explain more than
half of the observed convergence in High School dropout rates and
college attendance rates between Hispanics and other groups following
the Great Recession. The results are robust to specification checks for
endogenous migration and highlight the impact shocks to opportunity
cost can have on educational decisions of a historically disadvantaged
group.
