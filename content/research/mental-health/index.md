title: School Closures,Social Isolation, and Mental Health
---

**Preliminary Idea**

A large number of schools closed or shifted to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. These closures may have affected children in many ways. In this paper, we will examine the effect of school closures on mental health outcomes of children and adolescents during the COVID 19 pandemic. In particular, we intend to test the immediate as well as delayed effect of school closures on mental health related diagnoses and mental health care utilization of school-age children (age 5-17 years old).
