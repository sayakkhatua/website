      <description>Statistical power is the probability of obtaining a significant estimate, conditional on the true size of the underlying effect. Research funders commonly ask for ex-ante power calculations to determine whether the sample size of the proposed research is sufficient to demonstrate an effect. However, ex-ante power calculations often involve subjective judgments. The purpose of our study is to present a simple estimator of power that can be used after a study is completed.</description>
